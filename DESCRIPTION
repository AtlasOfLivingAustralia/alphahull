Description: Computation of the alpha-shape and alpha-convex
        hull of a given sample of points in the plane. The concepts of
        alpha-shape and alpha-convex hull generalize the definition of
        the convex hull of a finite set of points. The programming is
        based on the duality between the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay
        triangulation. The package also includes a function that
        returns the Delaunay mesh of a given sample of points and its
        dual Voronoi diagram in one single object.
